# **Shallow vs Deep Copy in JavaScript (with Immer)**

## 🚀 Introduction

This repository demonstrates the **difference between shallow and deep copy** in JavaScript, along with a practical solution using the **Immer** library for immutable state management. Understanding how objects are copied in JavaScript can help prevent unexpected bugs, especially when dealing with nested data structures.

## 🔍 Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

In JavaScript, copying objects is a common task, but there are key differences between **shallow** and **deep** copying:

### 🛠️ Shallow Copy
A **shallow copy** creates a new object, but nested objects or arrays are still referenced. Changes to nested structures affect both the original and copied object.

Example:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Wireless Mouse", address: { city: "Dhaka" } };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };
obj2.address.city = "Khulna"; // Affects obj1 too!

console.log(obj1.address.city); // Output: Khulna
```

### 🔄 Deep Copy
A **deep copy** duplicates the entire object, including nested objects. Changes to one object do not affect the other.

Example:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Wireless Mouse", address: { city: "Dhaka" } };
const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1)); // Deep copy
obj2.address.city = "Khulna"; // Does not affect obj1

console.log(obj1.address.city); // Output: Dhaka
```

---

## 🧐 Why Does This Happen?

This behavior is due to how JavaScript handles objects:

- **Shallow copy**: Copies only the top-level properties. Nested objects remain references.
- **Deep copy**: Creates a fully independent copy, including nested structures.

## ⚡ Deep Copy Using Immer

**Immer** is a modern JavaScript library that makes working with immutable data structures easier by allowing you to make immutable updates with a simple API. With Immer, deep copies can be done effortlessly without manually managing nested objects.

### 🌱 Solution Using Immer:
```javascript
import produce from "immer";

const obj1 = {
    name: "Wireless Mouse",
    address: { city: "Dhaka", country: "Bangladesh" }
};

// Using Immer to create a deep copy and modify the object immutably
const obj2 = produce(obj1, (draft) => {
    draft.address.city = "Khulna";
});

console.log(obj1.address.city); // Output: Dhaka (unchanged)
console.log(obj2.address.city); // Output: Khulna (updated)
```

## 📝 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/immer-shallow-deep-copy.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the example or integrate the solution into your project:
   ```javascript
   import produce from "immer";
   
   const obj1 = { name: "Wireless Mouse", address: { city: "Dhaka" } };
   const obj2 = produce(obj1, (draft) => {
       draft.address.city = "Khulna";
   });

   console.log(obj1.address.city); // Dhaka
   console.log(obj2.address.city); // Khulna
   ```

---

## 💡 Examples

### 🧑‍💻 Example 1: **Shallow Copy with Spread Operator**
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Keyboard", address: { city: "Dhaka" } };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };
obj2.address.city = "Khulna";

console.log(obj1.address.city); // Output: Khulna (due to shallow copy)
console.log(obj2.address.city); // Output: Khulna
```

### 🧑‍💻 Example 2: **Deep Copy Using Immer**
```javascript
import produce from "immer";

const obj1 = { name: "Keyboard", address: { city: "Dhaka" } };
const obj2 = produce(obj1, (draft) => {
    draft.address.city = "Khulna";
});

console.log(obj1.address.city); // Output: Dhaka (unchanged)
console.log(obj2.address.city); // Output: Khulna (updated)
```

## 🔧 Conclusion

Shallow and deep copying in JavaScript are fundamental concepts that you should be aware of when working with objects and arrays. While shallow copies are faster, deep copies are essential when you need to ensure full independence between objects. Immer is an excellent tool to help with immutability, making deep copying simple and efficient.
